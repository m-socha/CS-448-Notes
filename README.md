# CS 448 (Database Systems Implementation) Course Notes

This repo contains notes based on the Winter 2019 offering of CS 448 at the University of Waterloo.
These notes are put together using a combination of course material, textbooks and some online resources.

These notes are written in Latex, after which they are compiled to create a pdf document. The notes.pdf
document is an up-to-date version of the pdf created using notes.tex.
